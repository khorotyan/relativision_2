Relativision 2 is visualization of relativity. It was done as part of my Capstone Project with the supervision of Professor Suren Khachatryan for University graduation. The work covers three scenes, each dedicated to visualizing some relativistic effects. 

The first one is a car scene where the time dilation, space contraction and velocity addition effects are demonstrated. The second scene is a space scene where the observer is a spaceship, flying at some speed provided by the user. The scene shows time dilation and space contraction effects that the observer in the spaceship observes. The final scene is again a space scene however this time only showing time contraction. The scene compares the times of two observers, one inside the spacecraft, and the other on the planet.
